You will see an arrow at the center of the screen.  Keep your attention focused on the arrow in the middle and select which direction the arrow is pointing.  If it is pointed to the left, press the green button and if it is pointed to the right, press the red button.  Ignore the other arrows and focus only on the one in the middle.  Be as fast as you can, but try to be accurate. It's ok if you miss some.
